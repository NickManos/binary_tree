This is a binary tree program that creates a tree of names and then performs
pre-order, post-order, and in-order depth first traversal on the tree printing
the values each time.

I create the nodes from a node class and assign the data for the tree manually
then call the traverse method which performs all three types of traversal on
the tree.
